# Arduino-PyAutoGUI-Automation
An automation that allows for pausing and changing the volume of a video using hand motions from a distance. 

*Note: Designed for youtube videos, but may work with other media players

Instructions:
  - Connect Arduino and sensor to computer, open and run .py script in background
  - Hold a hand in front of sensor to pause video 
  - Slowly move hand closer to turn volume up, move hand farther to turn volume down (note that sensitivity for these two actions may vary   for different sensors)
